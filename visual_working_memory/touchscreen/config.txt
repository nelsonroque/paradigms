prac_instruct_list:In this experiment you will be presented with colored squares briefly, they'll disappear, then the colored squares will be presented again, but one of the squares may or may not have changed color.***Your goal is to respond as accurately as possible whether a square changed color, but please make your response within 2 seconds.***If a square changed color press the Left touch screen button corresponding with Change.
